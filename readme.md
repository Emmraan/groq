## Project Status

# Overview

#### This project is created using the <a href="https://groq.com">Groq</a> API. A big thanks to the Groq team for providing the API for free, making it possible for me to create this project. Without it wouldn't have been feasible for me to pay for API keys.


# Running the Project Locally
#### To run this project on your local system, follow these simple steps:

#### First, go to the <a href="https://console.groq.com/keys">Groq Console</a> and create an API key. If you don't have an account on Groq, you'll need to create one first.
